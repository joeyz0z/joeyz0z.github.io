## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Xidian University and advised by Prof. [Bo Chen](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/).  My long-term research goal is to build an explainable multi-modality cognition system in which machines can reason, make logical decisions, and generate content like humans. 

## Research Interests
My current research lies in multi-modality understanding and generation. My research areas involve:
- **Image-to-text understanding:** VLM, visual captioning, VQA, prompt learning in vision-and-language models
- **Knowledge-aware machine learning:** retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge-enhancement
- **Remote sensing foundation models:** vision foundation models for multi-modality remote sensing tasks
- **Cross-modality image synthesizing:** SAR-to-optical generation
